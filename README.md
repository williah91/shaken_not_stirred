## Welcome

Welcome to **Shaken Not Stirred** 🍸, a BSc General Physics project poster by students at the University of Manchester 🎓. Here we dive into the science behind James Bond's iconic preference for vodka martinis shaken, not stirred 🔫. This project uses numerical methods and physics principles to explore the dynamics of shaking and stirring cocktails 🍹.

## Project Overview

Have you ever wondered why James Bond insists on his martinis being shaken? 🎲 Is it just a matter of taste, or is there a scientific reason behind it? We aim to answer that question by analyzing the physical effects of shaking versus stirring on a cocktail 🍸.

## Objectives

- Investigate the fluid dynamics of shaking and stirring 🌊.
- Simulate the mixing process using numerical methods 💻.
- Analyze the impact of shaking on dilution 🧪.
- Compare the results to determine if shaking truly makes a difference 🤔.

## Methodology

1. **Real Physics**: Using the Navier-Stokes and Diffusion partial differential equations with the Wilke-Change diffusion formula to model fluid flow 🌪️.  
2. **Numerical Simulations**: Using computational models to numerically compute the evolving states 📊.

## Why It Matters

The name's Bond, James Bond 🔫🍸🚗.

## Conclusion

Grab your cocktail shakers 🍹 and uncover the mystery of the iconic catchphrase 🎲🔍.
